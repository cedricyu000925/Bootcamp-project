This is my first data project, which I completed after I finish my data analytic bootcamp training. The goal of this project is to predict the number of students admitted in a Master's degree programme in the next few years from the moment I started this project. 
I also attempted to predict the ratio of male and female students in the future in the future as well.

The data in dataframe CSV file was obtained at my full-time deskjob. The CSV file contains of the cohort a particular student was in, with the number srepresenting the academic year there were in, and FT (full-time) or PT (part-time) as their study mode. 
The last column contains the gender of each student, either in M (male) or female (F).

The "Cohort Trend Analysis" file is a bar chart I plotted using Python to give myself a more easily comprehensible view of what were the changes of the number of students admitted in this particular Master's degree programme all along the years.

The "Prediction version 2" file is a Python command that, using the abovementioned dataframe, to make the prediction. I used different models to train the machine and predict what I would like to see.
